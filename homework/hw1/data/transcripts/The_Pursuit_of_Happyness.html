Just to look at<br> and study so I can choose better.<br> Okay, well, that's smart.<br> Yeah, make a list.<br> Can you spell everything<br> you're thinking of?<br> -I think so.<br> -All right. That's good.<br> -How you doing in here, man?<br> -Okay.<br> Can we go to the park today, after?<br> No, I gotta go to Oakland.<br> Well, maybe, we'll see.<br> Give me a kiss.<br> I'll talk to you later.<br> Excuse me.<br> Oh, excuse me...<br> ...when is somebody<br> gonna clean this off?<br> And the Y?<br> The Y. We talked about this.<br> It's an I in "happiness."<br> There's no Y in "happiness." It's an l.<br> I'm Chris Gardner.<br> I met my father for the first time<br> when I was 28 years old.<br> And I made up my mind<br> as a young kid...<br> ...that when I had children...<br> ...my children were gonna know<br> who their father was.<br> This is part of my life story.<br> This part is called "Riding the Bus. "<br> What's that?<br> It's a time machine, isn't it?<br> Seems like a time machine.<br> That seems like a time machine.<br> It's a time machine. Take me with you.<br> This machine...<br> ...this machine on my lap--<br> This guy, he has a time machine.<br> He travels in the past<br> with this machine and....<br> --it is not a time machine.<br> It's a portable<br> bone-density scanner.<br> A medical device I sell for a living.<br> Thank you for the opportunity<br> to discuss it with you.<br> -I appreciate it.<br> -We just don't need it, Chris.<br> It's unnecessary and expensive.<br> -Well, maybe next--<br> -Thank you.<br> It gave a slightly denser picture<br> than an x-ray for twice the money.<br> -Hey.<br> -Hey, baby.<br> -What happened?<br> -No, nothing.<br> Look, I can't get Christopher today.<br> Oh, no, you don't, Chris.<br> I'm back on at 7.<br> I know. I have got to go to Oakland.<br> So I gotta get Christopher home,<br> feed him, bathe him...<br> ...get him in bed,<br> and be back here by 7?<br> -Yes.<br> -And we got the tax-bill notice today.<br> -What are you gonna do about that?<br> -Look, this is what we gotta do.<br> You see that car? The one<br> with the pretty yellow shoe on it?<br> That's mine.<br> There's no parking near hospitals.<br> That's what happens<br> when you're always in a rush.<br> Thanks anyway. Very much.<br> -Maybe next quarter.<br> -It's possible.<br> I needed to sell at least two scanners<br> a month for rent and daycare.<br> I'd have to sell one more...<br> ...to pay off all of those tickets<br> under my windshield wiper.<br> The problem is...<br> ...I haven't sold any for a while.<br> Since when do you not like<br> macaroni and cheese?<br> Since birth?<br> -What's that?<br> -What?<br> -What is this?<br> -It's a gift for Christopher.<br> -From who?<br> -Cynthia from work.<br> It's for adults. Chris can't use it.<br> She didn't know.<br> What are you supposed<br> to do with it?<br> Make every side the same color.<br> Did you pay the taxes?<br> No, I'm gonna<br> have to file an extension.<br> -You already filed an extension.<br> -Yeah, well, I gotta file another one.<br> That's-- It's $650.<br> I'll have it in the next month.<br> That means interest, right?<br> -And a penalty?<br> -Yeah, a little bit.<br> Look, why don't you let me do this?<br> All right, just relax. Okay?<br> -Come here. Calm down.<br> -I have to go back to work.<br> Let's get ready for bed.<br> Hey, put your plate in the sink.<br> A few days ago I was presented<br> with a report I'd asked for...<br> ...a comprehensive audit, if you will,<br> of our economic condition.<br> You won't like it. I didn't like it.<br> But we have to face the truth...<br> ...and then go to work<br> to turn things around.<br> And make no mistake about it,<br> we can turn them around.<br> The federal budget is out of control.<br> And we face runaway deficits<br> of almost $80 billion...<br> ...for this budget year<br> that ends September 30th.<br> That deficit is larger than<br> the entire federal budget in 1 957.<br> And so is the almost $80 billion...<br> ... we will pay in interest<br> this year on the national debt.<br> Twenty years ago, in 1 960...<br> ...our federal government payroll<br> was less than $ 1 3 billion.<br> Today it is 75 billion.<br> During these 20 years, our population<br> has only increased by 23. 3 percent....<br> Man, I got two questions for you:<br> What do you do?<br> And how do you do it?<br> -I'm a stockbroker.<br> -Stockbroker. Oh, goodness.<br> Had to go to college<br> to be a stockbroker, huh?<br> You don't have to. Have to be good<br> with numbers and good with people.<br> -That's it.<br> -Hey, you take care.<br> I'll let you hang on to my car<br> for the weekend.<br> -But I need it back for Monday.<br> -Feed the meter.<br> I still remember that moment.<br> They all looked<br> so damn happy to me.<br> Why couldn't I look like that?<br> I'm gonna try to get home by 6.<br> I'm gonna stop by a brokerage firm<br> after work.<br> -For what?<br> -I wanna see about a job there.<br> Yeah? What job?<br> You know, when l--<br> When I was a kid, I could go through<br> a math book in a week.<br> So I'm gonna go see about<br> what job they got down there.<br> What job?<br> Stockbroker.<br> -Stockbroker?<br> -Yeah.<br> Not an astronaut?<br> Don't talk to me like that, Linda.<br> I'm gonna go down and see about this,<br> and I'm gonna do it during the day.<br> You should probably<br> do your sales calls.<br> I don't need you to tell me<br> about my sales calls, Linda.<br> I got three of them<br> before the damn office is even open.<br> Do you remember<br> that rent is due next week?<br> Probably not.<br> We're already two months behind.<br> Next week we'll owe three months.<br> I've been pulling double shifts<br> for four months now, Chris.<br> Just sell what's in your contract.<br> Get us out of that business.<br> Linda, that is what I am trying to do.<br> This is what I'm trying to do<br> for my family...<br> ...for you and for Christopher.<br> What's the matter with you?<br> Linda.<br> Linda.<br> This part of my life<br> is called "Being Stupid. "<br> Can I ask you a favor, miss?<br> Do you mind if I leave this here<br> with you just for five minutes?<br> I have a meeting in there<br> and I don't wanna carry that...<br> ...Iooking smalltime.<br> Here is a dollar and I'll give you<br> more money when I come back out.<br> Okay? It's not valuable.<br> You can't sell it anywhere.<br> I can't even sell it, and it's my job.<br> All right?<br> -Chris? Tim Brophy, Resources.<br> -Yes. How are you?<br> -Come with me.<br> -Yes, sir.<br> Let me see if I can find you<br> an application for our internship.<br> I'm afraid that's all we can do for you.<br> See, this is a satellite office.<br> Jay Twistle in the main office,<br> he oversees Witter Resources.<br> I mean, I'm-- You know,<br> I'm just this office.<br> As you can see, we got a hell of lot<br> of applications here, so....<br> Normally I have a resume sheet,<br> but I can't seem to find it anywhere.<br> -We....<br> -Thank you very much.<br> I need to go.<br> I'll bring this back.<br> -Thank you.<br> -Okay.<br> Trusting a hippie girl with my scanner.<br> Why did I do that?<br> Excuse me. Excuse me.<br> Like I said, this part of my life<br> is called "Being Stupid. "<br> Hey!. Hey!. Hey!. Don't move!.<br> Don't move!. Stay--!.<br> Stop!. Stop!.<br> Don't move!.<br> Stop this--!. Stop the train!<br> Stop!

What's it say?<br> -"Hot Rod."<br> -Did you have a nickname?<br> -Yep.<br> -What?<br> -"Ten-Gallon Head."<br> -What's that?<br> -I grew up in Louisiana, near Texas.<br> Everybody wears cowboy hats.<br> And a ten-gallon's a big hat.<br> I was smart back then,<br> so they called me Ten-Gallon Head.<br> -Hoss wears that hat.<br> -Hoss?<br> Hoss Cartwright on Bonanza.<br> -How do you know Bonanza?<br> -We watch it at Mrs. Chu's.<br> -You watch Bonanza at daycare?<br> -Yeah.<br> When? When do you watch it?<br> -After snack? After your nap?<br> -After Love Boat.<br> I made my list for my birthday.<br> -Yeah, what'd you put on there?<br> -A basketball or an ant farm.<br> -He says he's been watching TV.<br> -Oh, little TV for history.<br> -Love Boat?<br> -For history. Navy.<br> That's not the Navy.<br> I mean, he could<br> watch television at home.<br> We're paying you $1 50 a month.<br> If he's gonna be sitting around...<br> ...watching TV all day,<br> we're taking him out of here.<br> Go pay more at other daycare<br> if you don't like Navy TV.<br> You late pay anyway.<br> You complain. I complain.<br> Can you at least put the dog upstairs<br> in your room or something?<br> Bye.<br> I was waiting for<br> Witter Resource head Jay Twistle...<br> ...whose name sounded so delightful,<br> like he'd give me a job and a hug.<br> I just had to show him I was good<br> with numbers and good with people.<br> -Morning, Mr. Twistle.<br> -Good morning.<br> -Mr. Twistle, Chris Gardner.<br> -Hi.<br> I wanted to drop this off personally<br> and make your acquaintance.<br> I thought I'd catch you on the way in.<br> I'd love the opportunity to discuss...<br> ...what may seem like weaknesses<br> on my application.<br> We'll start with this, and we'll call you<br> if we wanna sit down.<br> -Yes, sir.

Wait!<br> That was my stolen machine.<br> Unless she was with<br> a guy who sold them too.<br> Which was unlikely...<br> ...because I was the only one<br> selling them in the Bay Area.<br> I spent our entire life savings<br> on these things.<br> It was such<br> a revolutionary machine.<br> -Can you feel it, baby?<br> -Oh, yeah.<br> You got me doing all the work.<br> What I didn't know<br> is that doctors and hospitals...<br> ...would consider them<br> unnecessary luxuries.<br> I even asked the landlord<br> to take a picture.<br> So if I lost one, it was like losing<br> a month's groceries.<br> Hey, hey! Wait! Wait!<br> Hey, get back here!<br> Hey, man, l--<br> -Who's he?<br> -He's that guy....<br> -Did you forget?<br> -Forget what?<br> You're not supposed<br> to have any of those.<br> -Yeah, I know.<br> -You have two now.<br> Hey.<br> Hey, Mom.<br> One, two, three!<br> -That's a basketball!<br> -Hey, hey.

This could<br> be a microscope or anything.<br> -No, it's not.<br> -There, there.<br> All right, come on.<br> Open him up. Open him up.<br> -That paper's a little heavy, huh?<br> -Yeah, but I got it.<br> You should've seen me<br> out there today.<br> Somebody stole a scanner.<br> I had to run the old girl down--<br> Whatever.<br> -What?<br> -Whatever, Chris.<br> What the hell<br> you got attitude about?<br> -"Whatever" what?<br> -Every day's got some damn story.<br> Hey, Roy.
